Readme:

This is a one to one country converter for EU3 To VIC2 so countries will carry over and be playable In VIC2

Install:

Paste files from this archive over VIC2 this is due to how the converter works not the mod so backup the folders or make a copy of VIC2

Copy Country_mappings.txt and cultureMap.txt to the converter folder and overwrite as needed and ensure the convert.bat is looking for the right VIC2 directory if you made a copy

Uninstall:

Delete Folders and restore backed up ones Etc

Error List:
1. Sometimes the game crashes after the end of the year so ensure you save before (Proberly a autosave problem?)
2. Game might get corrupted somehow down the road if you play for a long time from the start without saving after you start a game (May not happen anymore due to fixed 0_Names.csv)
