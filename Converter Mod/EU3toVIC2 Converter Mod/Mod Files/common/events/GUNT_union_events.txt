## A cultural union decision can be made when a major power of that culture has all the relevent CORE PROVINCES of the union nation under its sphere of influence.

## The general form of the event will but thus:

## For a given union
##	if that country does not exist (has no cores anywhere)
##		the country will get cores on all relevent provinces.
