1. Place the EU3 savegame file you want to convert in the converter directory (also rename it as input.eu3).
2. Edit configuration.txt with the location of your V2 install (required) and any other parameters you wish to set (optional).
3. Run EU3ToVic2.exe.
4. This should generate a conversion file called output.v2
5. Copy output.v2 to your victoria 2 savegames directory and load the converted savegame in Victoria 2.
6. If it crashes, leave a message on the forum thread. If possible, upload your EU3 savegame and the log.txt generated by the converter.
