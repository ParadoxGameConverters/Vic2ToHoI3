MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT VERSION OF THE CONVERTER PROGRAM. THERE IS ONE EACH FOR HTTT and DIVINE WIND.

----
EU3:HTTT version 4.1 or EU3:DW version 5.1

INSTRUCTIONS
----

1) Find the desired save file in "[YOUR EU3 DIRECTORY]/save games".
2) Copy the save game in to the directory of this converter, and rename it to "input.eu3"
3) Open the file "converter.bat".  At the top of the file there is a Victoria 2 directory.  Modify it so that it points to YOUR copy of Victoria 2.
4) Run "converter.bat".  This will create a file in the converters directory called "output.v2".
5) Copy "output.v2" to "[YOUR VICTORIA DIRECTORY]/save games" and run Victoria 2
6) Load the output game and immediately save the game.  Then resign, and load that game.  Enjoy!

THE CONVERTER MOD for VICTORIA 2
----

Zonix's CONVERTER MOD for VICTORIA 2 adds all the nations that exist in EU3 which are missing in Victoria 2.  This mod allows for complete 1 to 1 country mappings rather than using nations where possible.

As of version 0.2, the mod also contains missing cultures.

You can get it here: http://www.mediafire.com/?89zaze2sxgx1vlc

INSTRUCTIONS
1) Make a second copy of your VICTORIA 2 directory.  This will be the modified copy of victoria 2.  (Be sure to name it accordingly, so you don't get confused!)
2) Copy the three modded folders ("common", "gfx", and "localisation") in to your new VICTORIA 2 directory, overwriting the old files.
3) Copy the text files "country_mappings.txt" and "cultureMap.txt" in to the converter's directory, overwriting the old files.
4) Follow the instructions for converting a game, above.  You should now have a V2 game with all of your nations in tact!
