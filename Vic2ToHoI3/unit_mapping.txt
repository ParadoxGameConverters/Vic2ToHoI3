# Note: mappings with the hoi side empty will cause those units to be scrapped during the upgrade

# Note 2: the hoi side is a FILENAME in the units directory.
# Normally this is the same as the unit type (one exception is transport, for which the actual unit name is transport_ship).
# The actual unit type will be read out of the named file.
