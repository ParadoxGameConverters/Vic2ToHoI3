# Note: mappings with the hoi side empty will cause those units to be scrapped during the upgrade

# Note 2: the hoi side is a FILENAME in the units directory.
# Normally this is the same as the unit type (one exception is transport, for which the actual unit name is transport_ship).
# The actual unit type will be read out of the named file.

# The numerical suffix roughly corresponds to technology level of the unit. Valid values: hoi0 to hoi4
# hoi0 -> historical_model = 0 (Great War? for unit types available at 1936)
# hoi1 -> historical_model = 1 (Inter-War? for unit types available at 1936)
# hoi2 -> historical_model = 2 (1936? for unit types available at 1936)
# etc.

# The converter goes through the list sequentially when choosing which HoI3 unit to map to.
# For example, dreadnought: hoi1 = "battleship" hoi1 = "battleship" hoi2 = "battleship"
# First dreadnought will be made a level 1 battleship, second will be made a level 1 battleship, third will be made a level 2 battleship.
# Then, the selection loops back to the first mapping, so the fourth dreadnought will be made a level 1 battleship.

# Another example, irregular: hoi0 = "militia_brigade" hoi0 = "militia_brigade" hoi0 = "infantry_brigade" hoi0 = "militia_brigade"
# This means that one in every four irregular will be converted to level 0 infantry, and the rest will be made into militias

# Exclusive HoI3 units that have "usable_by = {}" in their files (i.e. Elite units in vanilla HoI3 TFH),
# will be skipped for selection unless the country can use them, so all countries except Italy would
# skip the HoI3 mapping of "Alpini_brigade".
# ADVANCED:
# You can use this to fine-tune the OOB conversion. For example, you can temporarily add "usable_by = { FRA }" to
# tfh\units\heavy_armor_brigade.txt and then add hoi0 = "heavy_armor_brigade" to the mapping for tank below.
# That will cause France to get the occasional heavy armor brigade, while other countries don't.
# Remember to revert the change in heavy_armor_brigade.txt afterwards to allow other countries to make them in game.
