Q: I got an error that mentions MSVCP140.dll. What do I do?
A : Go to the Visual Studio Redistributable page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=51682
	then click Download and select vcredist_x86.exe.
	Once it has downloaded, install it and run the converter again.

Q: I loaded the mod in HoI3, but the map is the same as default HoI3. How do I really load the mod?
A: Be careful where you're putting the mods. They seem to work best when put in the mod directory in the HoI3 install location,
	and not the one in My Documents nor the one in the tfh directory in the install location.

Q: I'm trying to convert a EU4 To Vic2 game and keep getting an error. What do I do?
A: You need to include the Vic2 mod from the EU4 to Vic2 converter to properly convert these games.

Q: Countries have the wrong flags in the conversion. How do I fix this?
A: Go to 'My Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron III\gfx' and delete the 'flags' folder.

Q: The converter keeps saying my paths are invalid, but I'm absolutely sure they are correct. How do I fix this?
A: In some cases, the converter can't properly handle the paths. This is especially true when there are non-ASCII characters in the path.
	To fix this, you can create a soft link from an easy to reach location (such as C:\Vic2Docs) to the actual folder, and then tell
	the converter about the easy to reach location.
