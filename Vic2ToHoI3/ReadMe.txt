INSTRUCTIONS
----

1) Find the desired save file in "[YOUR VIC2 DIRECTORY]/save games".
2) Copy the save game in to the directory of this converter, and rename it to "input.v2"
3) Open the file "configuration.txt".  In the file there is a line that reads 
	v2directory = "D:\Paradox Interactive\Victoria 2"
   Modify it so that it points to YOUR copy of Victoria 2.
4) In "configuration.txt", there is a line that reads
	hoi3directory = "D:\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron III"
   Modify it so that it points to YOUR copy of Hearts of Iron III.
5) Run "Vic2ToHoI3.exe".  This will create a file in the converters directory called "output.hoi3".
6) Copy "output.hoi3" to "[YOUR HOI3 DIRECTORY]/save games" and run Hearts of Iron 3
7) Load the output game and immediately save the game.  Then resign, and load that game.  Enjoy!
